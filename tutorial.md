My first markdown file
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<!-- regular HTML comment -->
<!--- special completely ignored comment --->




You can also embed plots, for example:


```r
plot(cars)
library(ggplot2)
```

![plot of chunk cars2](figure/cars2.png)
